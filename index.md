I am a computational social scientist whose research interests lie at the intersection of computer science, behavioral economics, and crowdsourcing.  My early work analyzed the relationship between network topology and human behavior.  Since then I have become one of the leaders in designing, building, and conducting "virtual lab" experiments using Amazon's Mechanical Turk.  I have used this methodology to study cooperation, honesty, group problem solving, and display advertising. Most recently, Iâ€™ve been studying the crowd workers who power many modern apps, websites, and AI systems which culminated in a book I coauthored titled Ghost Work, published in May 2019.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2007 under the supervision of Michael Kearns. After that I was a postdoctoral associate working with Jon Kleinberg in the Computer Science department at Cornell University and then I moved to the Human & Social Dynamics group at Yahoo! Research led by Duncan Watts.  More recently, I was a founding member of Microsoft Research - New York City and I just joined the Adaptive Systems and Interaction group of Microsoft Research - AI.
